Generally speaking, 
parameters like
site lat/long
date
is slewing
is parked

should be polled at handshaking, flags set if necessary

Ra and Dec every 3 sec and stored in a buffer in case a program asks more frequently
Side of pier or destination side of pier every 5 sec, stored in buffer
Is slewing every 5 sec but only after a slew command. When it returns false you can stop polling until the next slew.
Maybe it is wise to check "is slewing" before a slew, to see if it is ready to slew.

During parking, poll "is parked" every 3 sec, until it returns true.


Do we implement following stuff:

ApertureArea	
The area of the telescope's aperture, taking into account any obstructions (square meters)

ApertureDiameter	
The telescope's effective aperture diameter (meters)

AtHome	
True if the telescope is stopped in the Home position. Set only following a FindHome() operation, and reset with any slew operation. This property must be False if the telescope does not support homing.
